# Avatar_Generation_PyAvataaars
With all the metaverse craze, here is the code for generating your personalized avatar using python. You just need to install the PyAvataaars package and install the gtk file from https://github.com/.../GTK-for-Windows-Runtime..., I opted for gtk3-runtime-3.24.29-2021-04-29-ts-win64.exe, install it and remember to check add to environment path. Personalize your avatar with different parameters such as skin color, hair color, hair type and more.
